            <p>Apologies for my lack of manners! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marina White, and I am a video game 
                developer who aspires to use my skills in video game programming, game design, game user research, and technical 
                artistry to help create games that impact the heart and soul of all players.</p>

            <p>How it all Began</p>
        </div>
        <div class="normal-text">  
            <p>I was first introduced to the wonderful world of video games when I was only four years old, with my first game 
                console being the Nintendo DS lite. Though my catalogue of games grew gradually over the years, my love for 
                video games grew exponentially with every new experience of play. Throughout my life, I discovered and fell in love 
                with many different IPs, my favorites being Super Mario Bros, Bust-A-Move, Five Nights at Freddy's, Henry Stickman, 
                Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and especially Splatoon and Sonic the Hedgehog. Three years ago, I never 
                considered a possible future where I would become a video game developer myself, considering I had no computer 
                science skills, nor did I know the first thing on how to design a game. Thankfully, with the opportunity 
                presented to me by the University of Southern California, I am able to pursue my degree in Computer Science Games 
                and minor in Technical Game Art, where in pursuit of my education I continue to develop my skills, talent, and 
                creativity to bring my ideas to life.</p>

                    <p>For faster reactors, I present to you this game with a rather unstable reactor! Before you is a panel of 
                        three modules that need constant attention in order to keep the reactor stable. Solve the modules' puzzles 
                        to deactivate it and maintain stability&#8212ignore the module or make a mistake, and you will face a 
                        reactor meltdown. How long do you think you can survive?</p>    
                    <p>Bernobyl was developed over the period of a fifteen-week semester, produced under the standard ideation -> 
                        preproduction -> alpha -> beta -> postproduction -> release production timeline. This game was developed by 
                        me, alongside my partner developer, Martin Gong. I was the lead designer and artist for this project, and 
                        was responsible for handling the communication and logistics with my audio team from the Berklee College of 
                        Music.</p>

            <p>These other works here are smaller solo projects, all meant to be recreations of exhisting games. Each game placed 
                emphasis on a different fundamental aspect of video game programming at the time of its development.</p>

                        I am also repsonsible for the texture and model of SonicR featured in this animation. The other props
                        utilized in this animation were created by my other classmates and instructor. This animation was created
                        in Autodesk Maya and was rendered using Arnold Renderer.</p>

            <p>I plan to continue beuilding on my experience in the field of technical game art with a more heavy empahsis on
                rigging. In terms of video game programming and development, I will soon begin my journey of learning how to develop
                game engines that support 2D/3D graphics, collision detection, a.i. algorithms, shading, and various input devices.
                Most importantly, I am persuing to expand my industry experince by seeking internship opportunities in the game 
                industry. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I hope you stay tuned as more content is added to
                this site!</p>
