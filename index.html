            <p>Apologies for my lack of manners! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Marina White, and I am a video game 
                developer who aspires to use my skills in video game programming, game design, game user research, and technical 
                artistry to help create games that impact the heart and soul of all players.</p>

            <p>How it all Began</p>
        </div>
        <div class="normal-text">  
            <p>I was first introduced to the wonderful world of video games when I was only four years old, with my first game 
                console being the Nintendo DS lite. Though my catalogue of games grew gradually over the years, my love for 
                video games grew exponentially with every new experience of play. Throughout my life, I discovered and fell in love 
                with many different IPs, my favorites being Super Mario Bros, Bust-A-Move, Five Nights at Freddy's, Henry Stickman, 
                Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and especially Splatoon and Sonic the Hedgehog. Three years ago, I never 
                considered a possible future where I would become a video game developer myself, considering I had no computer 
                science skills, nor did I know the first thing on how to design a game. Thankfully, with the opportunity 
                presented to me by the University of Southern California, I am able to pursue my degree in Computer Science Games 
                and minor in Technical Game Art, where in pursuit of my education I continue to develop my skills, talent, and 
                creativity to bring my ideas to life.</p>
